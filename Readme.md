# Git Playground

I am using this repo to learn and play with Git. I wanted a safe place to play with merges, merge conflicts, rebases, stashes to name a few. Every day I work with Git, I learn a bit more. Git has made me a better programmer. It allows me to experiment with code without the fear of messing things up. My sincere thanks to Linus Torvalds, Junio Hamano, and the countless other people who keep Git working across every version.
